My first Blog. 


I am starting this series of post as a way of capture my journey as I start exploring theoretical and practical aspects of Machine Learning/ Deep Learning. My main goal is to leave a trail to which I can return to later in my life all the while making a roadmap for beginners who want to explore the field of ML/DL but are overwhelmed by the field.      

  My current plan is to go through the [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org) by Ian Goodfellow (father of GANs) and to make concise take-away points from each chapter, following which I plan on doing the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/).
